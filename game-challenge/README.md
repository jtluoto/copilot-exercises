# 🎮 GitHub Copilot Game Challenge 👾  
**Mission: Build a classic arcade game using GitHub Copilot prompts and minimal manual coding.**  

## 🚀 Getting Started  

### 🛠 Prerequisites  
Before you hit start, make sure you’ve:  
1. Formed an elite squad of 2-4 game developers (or at least people willing to pretend they are).  
2. Ensured everyone has access to GitHub.com or your company’s **GitHub Enterprise Server** 
3. Created an **empty** repository to summon your soon-to-be masterpiece.  

### 🎯 Next Steps  
1. **Pick your game** – Choose one of the example games in this folder, or go rogue and make up your own!  
2. **Draw inspiration** – Use the prompts from the example games as examples.
3. **Use Copilot like your life depends on it** – If you’re typing more than you’re prompting, you might be doing it wrong. 
4. **Plan (a little)** – Sketch out the game’s main features, split up the work, and assign roles 
5. **Make it cool** – Trey to impress other teams. After all, this IS a competition! Style points count. 
6. **HACK AWAY!** – Mash that keyboard and unleash your creation upon the world!

🏆 May the best game win! 🚀
